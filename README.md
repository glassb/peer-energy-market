# Peer-to-Peer Electricity Market
Project contributors: Ryan Hekman, Kelsey Sweeney, and Ben Glass

## Context
Implementation of a P2P Electricity Market on a distribution system with battery storage. Theory, problem formulation, and algorithms are based on the work from [Ullah & Park](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9369412) (2021)


## Problem Metrics
- **Nodes**: 4
- Network Model Type: Radial (Linearized DistFlow)
- Timesteps: 4
- Timestep Duration: 4 hours
- Optimization Solver: SciPy [Optimize] (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html).

## Notes

This project was completed for as a final project for EC500 at Boston University (Spring 2025).
